# Spotify-Music-Streaming-Analytics-Dashboard
Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Spotify streaming data using advanced DAX formulas to track user engagement, artist performance, and listening trends with actionable insights.

This repository presents a Power BI dashboard built to analyze and visualize Spotify streaming data, providing actionable insights into user listening behavior, artist popularity, and track performance. By leveraging advanced DAX formulas, the dashboard offers dynamic metrics, year-over-year comparisons, and user engagement patterns that can drive strategic decisions and improve content recommendations.

âœ… Project Highlights

Designed a robust data model integrating Spotify streaming history with a date dimension, enabling time-based analysis and trend exploration.

Created over 20 custom DAX formulas to derive key metrics and calculated columns, allowing for in-depth analysis of listening patterns and artist performance.

ðŸ“Š Key Metrics & DAX Implementations

Some of the significant formulas implemented include:

# Average Listening Time

Avg Listening Time = AVERAGE(SpotifyData[Minutes Listened])


Calculates the average minutes users listened to tracks.

# Track Frequency

Track Frequency = COUNTROWS(SpotifyData)


Measures how often each track was played.

# Distinct Artists Count

Distinct Artists = DISTINCTCOUNT(SpotifyData[Artist Name])


Counts the number of unique artists over a period.

# Year-over-Year (YoY) Listening Trend

YoY Listening = 
CALCULATE([Avg Listening Time], 
  SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))


Compares average listening time with the previous year.

# Top Artists Highlight (Min-Max Logic)

Top Artist = 
IF([Avg Listening Time] = CALCULATE(MAX([Avg Listening Time]), ALL(SpotifyData)), "Top Artist", "Other")


Identifies artists with the highest listening times.

# Listening Pattern by Weekday

Avg Listening by Weekday = 
AVERAGEX(
  FILTER(SpotifyData, WEEKDAY(SpotifyData[Date]) = 3),
  SpotifyData[Minutes Listened]
)


Analyzes listening patterns specific to weekdays.
